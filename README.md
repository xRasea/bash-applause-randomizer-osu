# bash-applause-randomizer-osu
literally two lines of code to manually change the applause.mp3 to something different at random

how to use:
__________________________________________

run mp3 to applause.sh in a folder containing only mp3s you want to use for applauses.

DO NOT RUN THAT FILE ON A SKIN FOLDER OR YOU'LL RENDER IT UNUSABLE.

I recommend deleting mp3 to applause afterwards if you're as stupid as I am.

put all the applause files in your skin folder alongside the randomizer.sh

run randomizer.sh

ctrl+alt+shift+s inside osu to reload the skin


yea

this is literally a hello world level program
