# bash-applause-randomizer-osu
literally two lines of code to manually change the applause.mp3 to something different at random

how to use:

1- 
run mp3 to applause.sh in a folder containing only mp3s you want to use for applauses.
DO NOT RUN THAT FILE ON A SKIN FOLDER OR YOU'LL RENDER IT UNUSABLE.
I recommend deleting mp3 to applause afterwards if you're as stupid as I am.

2-
put all the applause files in your desired folder alongside the randomizer.sh
run randomizer.sh
ctrl+alt+shift+s inside osu to reload the skin

yea
